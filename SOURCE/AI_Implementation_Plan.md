STREAM_3: Content (G3 content_creation) → (E2→E3)
```

### Critical Path Management
```
BOTTLENECKS: A1(database) → A4(services) → G1(learning_backend)
DEPENDENCIES: Auth must complete before any user features
PARALLEL_OPPORTUNITIES: UI development + Backend API development
VALIDATION_GATES: No phase advancement without validation completion
```

### Technical Decision Framework
```python
def implementation_decision(feature, complexity, business_value, technical_debt):
    if business_value > 8 and complexity < 5:
        return "IMPLEMENT_NOW"
    elif technical_debt > 7:
        return "REFACTOR_FIRST"
    elif complexity > 8:
        return "BREAK_DOWN_FURTHER"
    else:
        return "DEFER_TO_NEXT_PHASE"
```

### Error Recovery & Contingency
```
PLAN_A: Full feature implementation as specified
PLAN_B: Core feature with reduced complexity if timeline pressure
PLAN_C: Feature stub with future implementation hook if critical blocker
ROLLBACK: Each phase must be independently deployable and rollback-safe
```

## Implementation Commands
```bash
# Phase Alpha Execution
git checkout -b phase-alpha
npm init && npm install express bcrypt jsonwebtoken
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE jobseeker_dev;"
mkdir -p src/{models,services,controllers,middleware}
# ... continue with systematic implementation

# Validation Gates
npm test && npm run lint && npm run security-audit
docker-compose up -d && ./run-integration-tests.sh
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
```

This plan optimizes for:
- **Dependency awareness**: Nothing starts before prerequisites complete
- **Parallel efficiency**: Multiple streams where possible
- **Validation gates**: No advancement without verification
- **Risk mitigation**: Contingency plans and rollback capabilities
- **Business value**: Features prioritized by impact
- **Technical excellence**: Quality gates and performance targets

Execute systematically. Validate relentlessly. Iterate based on evidence.
